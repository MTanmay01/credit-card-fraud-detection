# credit-card-fraud-detection
6th Semester Data Science Project 1 on Credit Card Fraud Detection

# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The challenge is to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that the customers of credit card companies are not charged for items that they did not purchase

# Main challenges involved:
o	Enormous Data is processed every day and the model build must be fast enough to respond to the scam in time.
o	Imbalanced Data, that is, most of the transactions (99.8%) are not fraudulent which makes it really hard for detecting the fraudulent ones
o	Data availability as the data is mostly private
o	Misclassified data can be another major issue, as not every fraudulent transaction is caught and reported
o	Adaptive techniques used against the model by scammers

# SOLUTION:
o	The model used must be simple and fast enough to detect the anomaly and classify it as a fraudulent transaction as quickly as possible
o	Imbalance can be dealt with by properly using some methods which we will talk about in the next paragraph
o	For protecting the privacy of the user the dimensionality of the data can be reduced.
o	A more trustworthy source must be taken which double-check the data, at least for training the model.
o	We can make the model simple and interpretable so that when the scammer adapts to it with just some tweaks we can have a new model up and running to deploy.
